Consider a file system where the records of the file are stored one after another both physically and logically. A record of the file can only be accessed by reading all the previous records.  Design a C program to simulate the file allocation strategy.
Consider a file system that brings all the file pointers together into an index block. The ith entry in the index block points to the ith block of the file. Design a C program to simulate the file allocation strategy.
